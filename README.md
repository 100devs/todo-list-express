I work full-time (4/10s) and am not able to make the live classes due to my work schedule. I'll catch the VOD the next day or over the weekend for Thursday classes. 

Since I missed the project night, I'm not sure if I did this right, but what I did do was helpful for review and to get a better understanding. I mostly re-watched class 41 while going through this.

Thanks for everything, especially your time,
