This is a grocery list App that that allows users to keep track of items when they grocery shop.

# What I plan on adding:

     -A profile setting the user can reference to save a group of items. Such as if the user buys milk, eggs, butter, apples weekly then they can group it as "must needs" in their profile and add to future lists instead of having to input those items each time.
